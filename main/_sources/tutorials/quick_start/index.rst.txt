Quick Start
=======================

After the installation is complete, we can run some simple \
examples. This page will show you this.

Simple Translation
-----------------------

A simplest translation can be processed with the code below.

.. literalinclude:: simple.demo.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

The output result should be

.. literalinclude:: simple.demo.py.txt
    :language: text
    :linenos:

Most of the primitive data types supported by python can be \
turned back to runnable source code with ``potc``.

Scriptable Translation
--------------------------

If we need to translate multiple values, and dump the translation \
result to a runnable ``.py`` script, we can do like this

.. literalinclude:: vars.demo.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

The output result (as well as the dumped script) should be

.. literalinclude:: vars.demo.py.txt
    :language: python
    :linenos:

It is runnable, you can take a try.
